		<h2>Now is the time to invest in developing the pipeline of talent that will grow the "Startup Economy" in New York City - and the South Bronx is brimming with potential. </h2>
		<p>[sb]<sup>2</sup> will showcase that talent by giving at-risk students the opportunity to do work that demonstrates the ability to not only participate in the Startup Economy - but to advance it. From building soccer-playing robots to starting businesses, there are powerful examples of under-served students doing work that <strong>demands that we rethink how we look for and cultivate potential in at-risk youth.</strong></p>
        
	  <h2><strong>The mission of [sb]<sup>2</sup>  is threefold:</strong></h2>
		
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Connect the South Bronx community - particularly its youth - to the promise and excitement of the technology and startup world and vice versa.</li>
			
			<li>Provide the youth of the South Bronx with world-class education in technology, engineering, design, and entrepreneurship (TEDE) to be prepared to participate and contribute to the Startup Economy taking root in New York City.</li>
			
			<li>Nurture promising technology and social enterprise startups to grow into strong companies in which the South Bronx holds equity.</li>
